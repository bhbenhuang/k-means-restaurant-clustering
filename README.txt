Huang, Ben; Joshi, Alisha; Olave, Marianna; Sun, AngelaNETS 150 - Part 2 - ProjectMay 1, 2018Summary File:Name of Project:Applying K-Means Clustering to examine restaurant location clustering of specific restaurant categories and ZIP codes. 		Description of Project:Using the Yelp API, we have implemented a program that allows user to input the desired ZIP Code and restaurant category. The list of valid categories is found on Yelp’s restaurant documentation: https://www.yelp.com/developers/documentation/v3/all_category_list. After the user inputs the parameters, our program first GETs the text of restaurants through Yelp’s API (supporting instructions for use of Yelp API: https://www.yelp.com/developers/documentation/v3/business_search). Then after pulling the text, we parse for the coordinates of the restaurants of that type (such as greek, pizza, chinese, bagels. etc.). Using these coordinates, we apply the K-Means Clustering Algorithm, to determine the clustering of restaurants within a specific ZIP code, to answer questions such as, what’s the difference between Chinese and Greek restaurant clustering in 19107? What’s the difference between Chinese restaurant clustering in 19107 and 19104?Categories we have used:Implementation Empirical Analysis	Actual work breakdown (who did what):	Angela:- retrieving x and y coordinates from the ArrayList that Ben and Alisha output from Yelp web scraping- writing the distance formula and algorithm- Interpreting and explaining K-Means Clustering in the context of clustering restaurants of same type by ZIP code proximity-Drafted write-up-Helped with visuals for write-up		Alisha:- Debugged cluster-mean not updating issue in algorithm-Web scraping using Yelp API -Creating ArrayList of all restaurant coordinates, ZIP codes, and types-Determining that we should use K-Means Clustering instead of Schelling's Model-Implementing an algorithm to output ArrayList -creating table (visual) of IDs, zip codes, and restaurant types-Edited Write-Up		Ben:- Debugged cluster-mean not updating issue in algorithm-Web scraping for Yelp API-Determining that we should use K-Means Clustering instead of Schelling's Model-Creating ArrayList of all restaurant coordinates, ZIP codes, and types-Implementing K-Means Clustering Algorithm to output restaurant IDs based on inputs of ZIP and restaurant type-Edited Write-Up		Marianna:-Explained and implement K-Means Clustering in the context of clustering restaurants of same type by ZIP code proximity-Implementing K-Means Clustering Algorithm to output restaurant IDs based on inputs of ZIP and restaurant type-Edited Write-Up-creating table (visual) of IDs, zip codes, and restaurant types
